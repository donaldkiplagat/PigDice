      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>Involves two players. Player 1 goes first, rolls a die and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesn't roll a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn by holding which will add the total points accumulated and play moves to Player 2.<br>
          If one of the players rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn and he passes that die to the next player. Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined. </p>

      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>Same as Pig, except two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the turn total. If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends. If two 1s are rolled, the player's entire score is lost and their turn ends.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>This variant is the same as Two-Dice Pig, except rolling double 1's ends the player's turn,scores 25 points, and eliminates any other points the player may have accumulated that turn. If any other doubles are rolled, the player adds twice the value of the dice to the turn total.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
